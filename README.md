# El Proyecte Grande - Prototype

## Story

As your Codecool Journey comes closer to its conclusion, the time has come for a final Teamwork Project, 
that will put to test all of the programming skills you've obtained so far (and some new ones you will learn on the way)!

You have the freedom of choosing your teammates (assemble a team of 3-4 students) and the project's topic this time.
Think of an app that you would find useful in your daily activities, a tool that an employee of a certain industry might crave,
a fun game or something completely out of the box.

This project is meant to last until the end of the course. While Codecool will not give you any direct tasks to fulfill regarding your project, 
during each sprint,you and your team are expected to make incremental changes in a Scrum way, developing the project further and further,
adding new features, technologies, etc.

***Â¡Comience El Proyecte Grande!***

## What are you going to learn?

- how to work in a Scrum team
- how to create a prototype of your project
- how to grow your project from scratch

## Tasks

1. The second phase/sprint of El Proyecte Grande focuses on prototyping the Product, by implementing its core elements in a simplistic way with use of the target technology and some prototyping tools.
    - All the requirements from tasks below are fulfilled during this sprint.

2. Create a plan for the prototype of your Product
    - The plan contains a list of all most important features of the Product, that the prototype should have.
    - Each feature has a note of whether it's more technical (backend) or visual (frontend), so it can be later determined how it should be showcased in the prototype.
    - Based on this plan, a Sprint Backlog is created with all the necessary tasks for creating the prototype.

3. Create a visual prototype of your Product, that focuses on the UI/UX part.
    - A visual prototyping tool, like [Proto.IO](https://proto.io/), [JustInMind](https://www.justinmind.com/) or [FluidUI](https://www.fluidui.com/) was used to create the prototype of UI/UX of the Product.
    - The prototype contains a fully showcased Home Page of your Product Application with all the necessary information, pictures, buttons in place.
    - The prototype's layout was tested for compability with these most popular aspect ratios:
  - 16:9 (standard widescreen)
  - 9:16 (standard smartphone screen)
  - 9:18 (wide smartphone screen)
    - (OPTIONAL) The prototype's layout was also tested for compability with these less popular aspect ratios:
  - 4:3 (classic "box" aspect ratio, sometimes used in tablets)
  - 21:9 (ultrawidescreen)
  - 9:21 (ultrawide smartphone screen)

4. Create a technical prototype of your Application, that focuses on the technical solutions and core mechanics.
    - The prototype utilizes the target backend framework the Team has selected for this Application.
    - The prototype's frontend layer is very minimalistic, containing only the most necessary information and functionalities, without caring much for the visuals. Frontend is done with just basic HTML templates and maybe a bit of CSS/Bootstrap.
    - The prototype is built based on a simplified version of Application's architecture from ADD, that can be further developed into the target product in the sprints to follow.
    - The prototype doesn't operate on a real database. Instead, it uses fake hardcoded data.
    - Despite using fake data, the prototype contains a well developed Data Access layer. It's done with DAO or Repository design pattern in mind.
    - The Data Access layer utilizes abstraction and interfaces, so it's compatible with any sorts of data sources:
  - Hard-coded fake data
  - Files (text or JSON)
  - SQL databases
  - API
    - The prototype visually showcases 2-3 major features of your application (at least in a simplistic way).
    - The prototype took no longer than one sprint to create.
    - The prototype allows the user to understand what is the Product's target purpose.
    - Despite being "just a prototype", the prototype's code was written with all the good practices and rules in mind, like clean code, design patterns and SOLID principles.
